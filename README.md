This code is a pytorch implementation of our paper "BS-LDM: Effective Bone Suppression in High-Resolution Chest X-Ray Images with Conditional Latent Diffusion Models".

## Primary Contributions
1) We developed an innovative end-to-end conditional LDM, BS-LDM, designed for bone suppression in high-resolution CXR images (\(1024 \times 1024\) pixels). This model aids in the clinical diagnosis of lung diseases such as inflammation, tuberculosis, and masses or nodules.
2) We demonstrated the effectiveness of offset noise in generating low-frequency information in soft tissue images. Additionally, we introduced a dynamic clipping strategy to enhance the pixel intensity of the generated images.
3) We compiled a substantial and high-quality bone suppression dataset named SZCH-X-Rays, consisting of high-resolution paired CXR and DES soft tissue images from 818 patients gathered from partner hospitals. Moreover, we pre-processed and publicized 241 pairs of CXR and DES soft tissue images from the JSRT dataset.

## Proposed Method
Overview of the proposed BS-LDM. The top side of the framework describes the training process of BS-LDM, where the latent variables of the CXR images are used as conditional guidance for the estimation of the offset noise. At the bottom, the sampling process of BS-LDM is detailed, where the latent variables obtained after each sampling step are dynamically clipped to ensure that the resulting pixel intensities are consistent with real soft tissue images.

## Detailed Clinical Evaluation Results

### Image Quality Assessment
The soft tissue images generated by BS-LDM on the SZCH-X-Rays dataset were independently evaluated for image quality based on established clinical criteria  widely used to assess bone suppression efficacy. Three radiologists, with 6, 11, and 20 years of experience, respectively, conducted these evaluations at our partner hospitals. The average scores for lung vessel visibility, airway visibility, and degree of bone suppression were 2.758, 2.714, and 2.765, respectively, on a scale where the maximum score was 3. These results indicate that our BS-LDM not only effectively suppresses bones but also retains fine details and lung pathology.

### Diagnostic Utility Assessment
The diagnostic value of soft tissue imaging was independently evaluated by two radiologists with 6 and 11 years of experience, respectively, following the X-ray diagnostic standard. For this analysis, we used the SZCH-X-Rays dataset, which included confirmed lesions through computed tomography, covering common lung diseases such as inflammation, tuberculosis, and masses or nodules.

Among the 818 data pairs assessed, 79 pairs contained one or more of these lesions. The radiologists independently evaluated both the conventional CXRs and the soft tissue images generated by our model. The findings indicate that the soft tissue images produced by BS-LDM enable radiologists to diagnose lesions more thoroughly and accurately than conventional CXRs, thereby validating the high clinical diagnostic value of our model.
